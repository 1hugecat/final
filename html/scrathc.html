            <div class="leftcentertab">In last place we have the number 6. Some of the reasonings </div>

            <div class="leftcentertext">behind this are because it's an unlucky number that is associated with the
                devil.
                Another reason behind this is
                because there are just objectivly better numbers. Number 6's base components are 3 and 2 which put it
                down to
                ten because of it's unoringinality. This number is also so funky looking so...</div>

            <div class="leftcentertext">In chinese it sounds similiar to word for death which is why it's regarded as an
                unlucky number. It's
                components are 2 so it's not as bad as 6 but has some unoringinality. it'a a pretty fun number besides
                that being
                associated with squares and rectangles. </div>

            <div class="leftcentertext">being related to self. I put it in 8th because number 1 is kinda basic. Though
                it being the first number put it above
                other numbers. It's not used a lot by itslef in multiplication and division. Also 1 is the lonliest
                number. </div>

            <div class="leftcentertext">being associated with longevity and good fortune. This number also happens to be
                an unlucky number in addition to lucky because in Japanese it's similiar to the word for suffering.
                Number 9 isn't too original
                becasue it's components are 3 but it does have
                interesting multiplication habitis. This number is also similiar to number 6 in the way it looks so
                that's why it's in 7th.</div>
            <br>

            <div class="leftcentertext"> associated with
                creativity, communication, and self-expression. This also a prime number so in the origniality catergory
                it's pretty high. Number 3 is also associated with triangles making it higher on the ranking.</div>

            <div class="leftcentertext"> math with it being
                used in simplifying numbers. It's also the easiest number to multiply with. It isn't to most original
                with it's components being 2 and 5 because of this I put it in 5th. </div>

            <div class="leftcentertext">perfection.
                This number is also a prime number. I think this is a really unique number and we us it to represent the
                amount of days in a week. 7 is one of the most used lucky numbers. I put it in 4 because it's so unique
                but
                I still think it falls short to others.</div>

            <div class="leftcentertext">repreesents wealth.
                Number 8 isn't the most unique with it's components being 2 and 4 but having these 2 numbers be it's
                components make it an interesting number in math. The reason though it's in 3rd is because 8 uses the
                same symbol as infinty. it's design is also really unique compared to other numbers. </div>

                easiest to use in multiplication. Number 5 also is a prime number giving it uniqueness. 5 is a great
                number to use and has a great design though it's similiar to 2's design.</div>

            <div class="leftcentertext">Number 2 is the best
                number because of it's use. A lot of thing come in 2s like socks and shoes. Also in math every even
                number is divisible by 2. It's also unique because it's the only number that has the same result when
                you multiply it by itself and when you add it to itself. I think because of it's uniqueness, use in
                math, and use in the world it's the best number. </div>
